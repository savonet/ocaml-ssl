      versions. *)

      called again later. *)
  | Error_want_write
  (** The operation did not complete; the same TLS/SSL I/O function should be
      called again later. *)
  | Error_want_x509_lookup
  (** The operation did not complete because an application callback set by
      [set_client_cert_cb] has asked to be called again.  The TLS/SSL I/O function
      should be called again later. Details depend on the application. *)
  | Error_syscall
  (** Some I/O error occurred.  The OpenSSL error queue may contain more
      information on the error. *)
  | Error_zero_return
  (** The TLS/SSL connection has been closed.  If the protocol version is SSL
      3.0 or TLS 1.0, this result code is returned only if a closure alert has
      occurred in the protocol, i.e. if the connection has been closed cleanly. Note
      that in this case [Error_zero_return] does not necessarily indicate that the
      underlying transport has been closed. *)

      called again later. *)
